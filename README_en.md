VAP(Video Animation Player) is a fantastic animation player. It can play video with alpha channel.

* Compared with Webp or Apng animation, it has the advantages of high compression rate (smaller material) and hardware decoding.


* Compared with Lottie, it can achieve more complex animation effects (such as particle effects)
